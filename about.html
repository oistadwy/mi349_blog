        <article>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my fitness blog! </p>
            <p>
                I am Wyatt Oistad. I am a 21 year old male that attends Michigan State University. I am a full time PACS Administrator for MSU Radiology and I take classes part time. In my spare time I love to go to the gym and watch sports. I first started lifting in March of 2021. Since then I have learned a great deal about what it takes to gain strength and muscle. 
            </p>
            <h3>My Personal Records at 170 pounds:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bench press: 225 pounds</li>
                <li>Squat: 335 pounds</li>
                <li>Deadlift: 365 pounds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is a picture of when I hit 365 deadlift for the first time</p>

                The main purpose of this blog is to spread knowledge around strength, muscle, and dieting. I have learned a lot so far, but I know there is so much more to discover. I hope that my posts will help you achieve your goals and answer all your fitness questions.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my blog! I hope you find it informative!</p>
