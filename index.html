        <h2>What is PPL (Push, Pull, Legs)?</h2>

            <p>
                PPL or push, pull, legs; is a training split for any lifter no matter their experience in the gym. Typically a PPL split is push on Monday/Thursday, pull on Tuesday/Friday, and legs on Wednesday/Saturday. Although this is the most common order these workouts can be done in whatever order you prefer. This can often be a lot of commitment for new lifters, the volume can be reduced by doing only one of each workout a week. For example, Monday is pull, Wednesday is push, and Friday is Legs. For myself, I prefer the typical 6 days a week schedule. I highly recommend taking at least one day a week to rest and give your body a break.

                On push day, 3 major muscle groups are the focus: chest, shoulders, and triceps. Most exercises that target these muscle groups are done in a pushing motion, such as bench press. For pull day, 2 muscle groups are targeted: back and biceps. Legs are a little more complicated, there are many different muscles that you can target, but the main two are quads and hamstrings. When setting up your routine for each day your goal should be two exercises per muscle. For example, on leg day I would back squat and do machine leg extensions, these both target the quads. After that I would do RDLs (romanian deadlifts) and machine leg curls, these work the hamstrings.

            <h2>What workouts should you do on pushday?</h2>
            <p id="author"><em>By Wyatt Oistad</em></p>
            <p>
                There are two different ways to approach a workout: do you want to get everything out of it and time doesn't matter, or are you in a time crunch and just want to hit the essentials. First, let's talk about getting everything out of a workout even if you are in the gym for two hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the gym and a normal gym session, for me, is between one hour and thirty minutes and two hours. I shoot to hit every muscle at least twice and oftens three times. I start every workout with ten minutes of stretching and warming up to help prevent injury and get my blood flowing. Since we are hitting push today that means I am starting with bench press. Bench press is a great workout that hits chest, shoulders and triceps. The next chest exercise I do is cable flies. These really stretch out the pectoral muscle and work it in places the bench press doesnâ€™t. Next we are moving into shoulders. I like doing some form of should press first, this targets the front deltoid. Next is lateral raises, these can be done with dumbbells or cables. I would consider lateral raises to be one of the most important exercises in any program if you are trying to get bigger shoulders. Lastly, for triceps I like doing three exercises. Starting with cable pushdowns to hit the short head of the tricep, then overhead tricep extensions to hit the long head. Last, I like doing a form of skull crusher to finish.
